# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## By: Abdulhakim Mohamed


# Overview of the analysis: 
## The purpose of this analysis was to figure out using SQL how many number of retiring employee's were there including their title. As well as figuring out how many employees were eligibale for a mentorship program by determining their birth date as well as their start date of employment. Initally creating a summary report for the manager. We use postgres sql and pgadmin for our database and gui, we then create a schema which helped us get a better understanding of our relatinal database. The main primary keys were emp_no and dep_no. These helped us link our data togather in order to help us gain the information we needed to find the retiring employess and their titles.

## The second major point is that only two are managers and majority of them are all technical postition.
### Technically postions are hard to fill with the lack of qualified pro's in the market as well as the amount of time and process it takes to hire a good fit. The company is going to have to figure out their replacement plan very quickly without it being a major emergancy.
